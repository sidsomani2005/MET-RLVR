Wait, the problem says \"every ticket bought that exceeds 10.\" So, does that mean that for each ticket beyond the 10th one, he gets a 5% discount? Wait, but he bought 12 tickets. So, the first 10 tickets are not eligible for the discount, and the remaining 2 tickets are? Or is it that for every ticket that is beyond 10, meaning each ticket after the 10th one? Let me read the problem again.\n",
